# Technical Debt & Refactor Opportunities

This document summarizes the major areas of technical debt and refactor opportunities identified in the project. Addressing these will improve maintainability, extensibility, and developer velocity.

---

## 1. Entity System
- **Issue:** Entities like grass, trees, and rocks are not proper classes; their behavior is defined in ad-hoc modules or objects.
- **Impact:** Difficult to extend or override entity behavior in a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) way; adding new entity types or features is cumbersome.
- **Next Steps:** Refactor entities into ES6 classes or a unified entity/component system. Support inheritance and shared logic for common behaviors (e.g., collision, rendering, interaction).

## 2. UI Modularity & Reuse
- **Issue:** UI components (inventory, macro, skins, etc.) are not sufficiently modular; code is not reused across similar components.
- **Impact:** UI changes require edits in multiple places; inconsistent look/feel; harder to add new UI features.
- **Next Steps:** Refactor UI into reusable modules/components. Extract shared logic (e.g., dialog management, input blocking, grid layouts) into utility modules. Consider a lightweight component pattern.

## 3. Code Duplication
- **Issue:** Some logic (e.g., entity rendering, UI event handling) is duplicated across files.
- **Impact:** Increases maintenance burden and risk of bugs; fixes must be applied in multiple places.
- **Next Steps:** Identify and extract common logic into shared utility functions or base classes. Use DRY principles throughout the codebase.

## 4. File Size & Modularity
- **Issue:** Some files are too long and contain multiple responsibilities.
- **Impact:** Harder to navigate, understand, and maintain; increases merge conflicts.
- **Next Steps:** Split large files into focused modules. Group related logic by feature or responsibility.

## 5. Module/Dependency System
- **Issue:** The project uses a homegrown module system (not Node.js or ES modules); initialization is spread across multiple files and not orchestrated from a single entry point (e.g., `init.js`).
- **Impact:** Hard to track dependencies and initialization order; risk of race conditions or missed setup steps.
- **Next Steps:** Centralize initialization in a main entry point. Consider adopting a more formal module pattern or build step if feasible.

## 6. Testing
- **Issue:** No automated tests; all testing is manual.
- **Impact:** Increases risk of regressions; slows down refactoring and feature development.
- **Next Steps:** Add unit tests for core logic (e.g., entity behavior, world generation, UI state). Consider lightweight test runners or browser-based test harnesses.

## 7. Performance & Async Patterns
- **Issue:** Async patterns (e.g., image preloading, cache population) are robust, but some legacy code may not expect Promises or async/await.
- **Impact:** Potential for subtle bugs or race conditions if async code is not handled consistently.
- **Next Steps:** Audit all async code paths. Ensure all cache and resource loading is properly awaited where needed. Document async APIs clearly.

**Addressing these areas will make the codebase more maintainable, extensible, and ready for future features (e.g., multiplayer, advanced UI, modding).**
