# Step 4: Configuration and Skins - Requirements

## Overview
This document defines the requirements for a robust, fully configurable UI system and skinning architecture for the game. The goal is to enable both developers and end-users to completely customize the appearance, layout, and behavior of all UI components at runtime, and to save/load these configurations as "skins" that can be shipped with the game or shared by users.

## Goals
- **Full UI Configurability:** Every aspect of the UI (style, layout, text, structure, etc.) must be defined in a configuration object, not hardcoded in the UI-building code.
- **Runtime Editing:** Users (and developers) must be able to edit the UI configuration at runtime via an in-game editor or external tool.
- **Serialization:** The entire UI configuration must be serializable to and from JSON, allowing saving to localStorage, file, or server.
- **Skin System:** The game must support multiple UI skins, including a default shipped skin and user-created skins. Skins can be loaded, saved, and swapped at runtime.
- **No Hardcoded UI Values:** All style, layout, and text values (colors, fonts, paddings, margins, labels, ordering, etc.) must be sourced from the configuration, not from literals in the code.
- **Extensibility:** The configuration system must be extensible to support new UI components, new style properties, and new layout paradigms as the game evolves.
- **UI State Persistence:** When a user customizes the UI, their configuration should persist across sessions (via localStorage or user profile).
- **Developer/Designer Workflow:** Developers and designers should be able to design a UI in-game, export the config, and ship it as the default or as an optional skin.

## Requirements

### 1. UI Configuration Object
- Every UI component (action bars, macros, inventory, input bar, menu bar, etc.) must have a corresponding configuration object.
- The configuration must include all style (CSS), layout, text, and structure values.
- The configuration must be hierarchical and support nested components.
- The configuration must be easy to extend with new properties.

### 2. No Hardcoded UI Values
- No UI-building code may contain hardcoded style, layout, or text values.
- All such values must be referenced from the configuration object.
- Any new UI code must follow this pattern.

### 3. Serialization and Persistence
- The entire UI configuration must be serializable to JSON.
- The configuration can be saved to and loaded from localStorage, file, or server.
- The system must provide functions to export/import the configuration.
- The system must support resetting to the default skin.

### 4. Runtime Editing
- Users must be able to edit the UI configuration at runtime via an in-game editor (or, initially, by editing JSON directly).
- Changes must be immediately reflected in the UI.
- The editor must allow saving/loading/exporting/importing skins.

### 5. Skin System
- The game must ship with a default skin (UI configuration).
- Users can create, save, and load their own skins.
- Skins can be shared as JSON files.
- The system must support hot-swapping skins at runtime.

### 6. Extensibility and Future-Proofing
- The configuration system must be designed to support new UI components and properties.
- The system should allow for future features like theme variables, responsive layouts, and per-user or per-profile skins.

### 7. Documentation and Developer Guidance
- All configuration properties must be documented.
- Developers must be provided with clear guidelines for adding new UI components to the configuration system.

## Out of Scope (for this step)
- The actual in-game UI editor (can be a future step).
- Server-side skin sharing (can be a future step).
- Non-UI configuration (e.g., game logic, world gen) unless directly related to UI/skin.
