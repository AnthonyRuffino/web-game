# Step 2: Advanced Game Features and Systems

This document outlines the next phase of development, building upon the solid foundation established in Step 1. Step 2 focuses on implementing core gameplay systems, collision detection, UI elements, and developer tools.

## üéØ Step 2 Overview

**Goal:** Transform the basic movement prototype into a functional game with obstacles, UI, and core systems.

**Prerequisites:** Step 1 must be 100% complete (‚úÖ Confirmed)

---

## üß± Core Systems Implementation

### 1. Obstacles and Collision Detection ‚úÖ (Partially Implemented)
- **Current Status:** Basic grid system exists
- **Requirements:**
  - Implement collision detection between player and world objects
  - Add solid obstacles (trees, rocks, walls) that block movement
  - Ensure collision detection works in both perspective modes
  - Add visual feedback for collision (optional: player stops, visual indicator)
  - Support for different collision types (solid, passable, etc.)

### 2. Console Commands and Developer Tools
- **Requirements:**
  - `teleport(x, y)` - Move player to specific world coordinates
  - `setSpeed(value)` - Change player movement speed
  - `printPlayerStats()` - Display current player position, angle, speed
  - `spawnItem("itemName")` - Spawn items at player location
  - `setZoom(value)` - Control zoom level programmatically
  - `togglePerspective()` - Switch between camera modes
  - Extensible command registry for future commands

### 3. Basic UI System
- **Requirements:**
  - Inventory toggle with `B` key
  - Grid-based inventory layout (configurable, default 5x5)
  - Click detection for inventory slots
  - Visual feedback for hover and selection
  - Inventory state management (open/closed)

### 4. Action Bar Implementation
- **Requirements:**
  - 10-slot action bar at bottom of screen
  - Number keys 1-0 to trigger slots
  - Mouse click support for slot activation
  - Visual feedback for hover and click
  - Configurable slot count
  - Support for future item/spell binding

### 5. Crafting UI and Recipe System
- **Requirements:**
  - Crafting menu accessible from inventory
  - Display 4 starter recipes:
    - Crafting Table
    - Torch
    - Furnace
    - Wooden Spear
  - Recipe requirements and materials display
  - Craft button with success/failure feedback
  - Extensible recipe system for future items

## üóÇÔ∏è New Files Required

### 1. `collision.js`
- **Purpose:** Collision detection and spatial query system
- **Contents:**
  - Collision detection algorithms
  - Spatial partitioning (simple grid-based for now)
  - Collision response handling
  - Support for different object types

### 2. `ui.js`
- **Purpose:** User interface management
- **Contents:**
  - Inventory UI rendering and logic
  - Action bar rendering and interaction
  - Crafting UI rendering and logic
  - UI state management
  - Click detection and event handling

### 3. `items.js`
- **Purpose:** Item system and management
- **Contents:**
  - Item definitions and properties
  - Inventory management
  - Item spawning and collection
  - Item rendering (shapes for now, sprites later)

### 4. `crafting.js`
- **Purpose:** Crafting system and recipes
- **Contents:**
  - Recipe definitions
  - Crafting logic and validation
  - Material requirements checking
  - Crafting success/failure handling

### 5. `console.js`
- **Purpose:** Developer console and debugging tools
- **Contents:**
  - Command registry and parsing
  - Built-in commands (teleport, stats, etc.)
  - Command history and help system
  - Extensible command system

   - Implement inventory toggle and basic layout
   - Add click detection for UI elements

4. **Action Bar**
   - Implement 10-slot action bar
   - Add keyboard and mouse interaction
   - Visual feedback system

### Phase 2C: Advanced Features (Priority 3)
5. **Crafting System**
   - Implement recipe definitions
   - Create crafting UI
   - Add basic crafting logic

6. **Item System**
   - Implement item definitions

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Collision Testing
- [ ] Player cannot move through solid obstacles
- [ ] Collision works correctly in both perspective modes
- [ ] Collision detection is efficient (no performance issues)
- [ ] Visual feedback for collision (optional)

### Console Commands Testing
- [ ] `teleport(x, y)` moves player to correct coordinates
- [ ] `setSpeed(value)` changes movement speed
- [ ] `printPlayerStats()` displays accurate information
- [ ] Commands work in both perspective modes

### UI Testing
- [ ] Inventory opens/closes with `B` key
- [ ] Action bar responds to number keys 1-0
- [ ] Mouse clicks work on UI elements
- [ ] Visual feedback is clear and responsive

### Crafting Testing
- [ ] Crafting menu opens from inventory
- [ ] Recipes display correctly
- [ ] Crafting logic works as expected
- [ ] Success/failure feedback is clear

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2 Completion Criteria

### Minimum Viable Step 2
- [ ] Collision detection prevents player from moving through obstacles
- [ ] Console commands work for teleporting and viewing stats
- [ ] Inventory can be opened/closed with `B` key
- [ ] Action bar responds to number keys 1-0
- [ ] Basic crafting UI displays starter recipes

### Full Step 2 Completion

## üöÄ Post-Step 2 Roadmap

After Step 2 completion, the game will have:
- Functional collision and obstacle system
- Complete UI framework
- Developer tools and debugging capabilities
- Foundation for item and crafting systems

**Next phases will include:**
- Animation systems
- Resource gathering mechanics
- Building placement system
- Advanced procedural generation

## üìã Development Notes

- **Modularity:** Each new system should be self-contained and expose clear APIs
- **Performance:** Maintain 60 FPS during development
- **Testing:** Test all features in both perspective modes
- **Extensibility:** Design systems to be easily expandable
- **Debugging:** Maintain console access for all major systems
