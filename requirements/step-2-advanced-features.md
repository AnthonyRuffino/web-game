# Step 2: Advanced Features

> **Note:** World wrapping functionality has been temporarily skipped to focus on improving world generation and entity rendering. The world is now large enough that wrapping issues occur less frequently.

## Overview

This document outlines the next phase of development, building upon the solid foundation established in Step 1. Step 2 focuses on implementing core gameplay systems, collision detection, UI elements, world structure, and developer tools.

## 🎯 Step 2 Overview

**Goal:** Transform the basic movement prototype into a functional game with world structure, obstacles, UI, and core systems.

### 11. Crafting UI and Recipe System
- **Requirements:**

  - Display 4 starter recipes:
    - Crafting Table
    - Torch
    - Furnace
    - Wooden Spear
  - Recipe requirements and materials display
  - Craft button with success/failure feedback
  - Extensible recipe system for future items

### 12. Macro Management UI System (NEW)

**Extensibility Note:**
- The action bar binding system must be designed to support more than just macros in the future.
- It should allow binding spells, abilities, consumable items, and custom player controls (e.g., auto-run, open inventory, open quests dialog, toggle lock-action bars, etc.).
- The data model for bindings should be flexible enough to store different types of actions (macros, spells, items, controls, etc.).
- The invocation system should be extensible: currently it only invokes commands, but in the future it must be able to invoke spells, use items (showing item icons and greying out if unavailable), and trigger custom control actions.
- The UI should be able to display the correct icon and state for each binding type (e.g., item icons, spell icons, macro icons, greying out if not usable).

**Overview:**
- Introduce a visual macro management system accessible via the `/macro` command or a UI button.
- Users can create, edit, delete, and bind macros through a pop-up grid UI similar to the inventory.

**UI/UX Requirements:**
- Macro grid UI:
  - Launched from `/macro` command or UI button.
  - Grid layout, each cell is a macro slot (empty or filled).
  - Clicking an empty cell opens a macro creation dialog.
  - Clicking a filled cell opens an edit dialog for that macro.
- Macro creation dialog:
  - Input for macro name (required, unique). When this component has the focus, inputs should be blocked for movement and keybinds.
  - Input for macro command (required). When this component has the focus, inputs should be blocked for movement and keybinds.
  - PNG icon upload (with preview, not saved until macro is saved).
  - Button to generate a random icon (uses existing random icon logic, previewed but not saved until macro is saved).
  - Save button to create macro and persist to localStorage.
- Macro edit dialog (acceissible after clicking on an existing macro in the macro gird):
  - Edit name, command, or icon (upload or randomize).
  - Delete macro button.
  - Bind to action bar:
    - Dropdown to select action bar name.
    - Dropdown to select slot (populated based on selected bar).
    - If a slot is already bound, new macro replaces the old one.
  - Save changes button.
- Macro deletion:
  - Deleting a macro does not automatically remove its action bar binding; orphaned bindings are allowed.
  - If a macro is deleted, action bar slot may show missing icon or error on use (acceptable for now).

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add `/macro` command to open the macro management UI.
2. Implement macro grid UI (modal/pop-up, similar to inventory grid).
3. Implement macro creation dialog:
   - Name, command, PNG upload, random icon, preview, save.
4. Implement macro edit dialog:
   - Edit/delete macro, change icon, rebind to action bar slot.
5. Integrate with existing macro storage and action bar binding logic.
6. Ensure all macro data (including icon) is only saved to localStorage on save.
7. Allow preview of uploaded or generated icon before saving.
8. Update documentation and help commands to reflect new macro UI system.

**Testing Requirements:**
- [ ] Macro grid UI opens from `/macro` command or button.
- [ ] Empty cell click opens creation dialog; filled cell click opens edit dialog.
- [ ] PNG upload and random icon generation work and preview correctly.
- [ ] Macros can be created, edited, deleted, and bound to action bar slots.
- [ ] Macro data is only saved on explicit save.
- [ ] Deleting a macro does not break the game if its slot is still bound.
