# Step 2: Advanced Features

> **Note:** World wrapping functionality is implemented, but some edge cases and chunk logic may need further refinement. The world is large enough that wrapping issues are rare in normal play.

## Overview

This document outlines the next phase of development, building upon the solid foundation established in Step 1. Step 2 focuses on implementing core gameplay systems, collision detection, UI elements, world structure, and developer tools.

## üèÅ Step 2 Overview

**Goal:** Transform the basic movement prototype into a functional game with world structure, obstacles, UI, and core systems.

**Prerequisites:** Step 1 must be 100% complete (‚úÖ Confirmed)

## üß© Core Systems Implementation

### 1. World Background & Visual Feedback ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Complete
- **Features:**
  - Background texture for entire playable world (dots pattern)
  - Configurable dot size, spacing, color, alpha
  - Preset configurations and console commands (`bgconfig`, `bgset`, `bgpreset`)

### 2. World Structure & Wrapping ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Complete (edge cases may need refinement)
- **Features:**
  - Finite rectangular world with edge wrapping
  - Configurable world size
  - Deterministic starting position based on world seed
  - Console commands for world management (`worldinfo`, `setseed`, `restartgame`)

### 3. Grass Tiles & Basic World Objects ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Complete
- **Features:**
  - Procedural placement of grass, trees, rocks (deterministic, hash-based)
  - Grass tiles visually distinct, non-interactive (Step 2)
  - Console command `worldobjects` for generation info

### 4. Procedural Generation & Starting Position ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Complete
- **Features:**
  - Deterministic starting position selection
  - Consistent world layout across sessions with same seed
  - Console commands for seed management

### 5. Basic Persistence System ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Complete
- **Features:**
  - Periodic saving of player position and world seed to localStorage
  - Manual save/load commands (`save`, `load`)
  - Save info and management commands (`saveinfo`, `clearsave`, `persistence`)
  - Game resumes exactly where left off after refresh

### 6. Obstacles and Collision Detection ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Complete
- **Features:**
  - Collision detection between player and world objects (trees, rocks)
  - Solid obstacles block movement
  - Collision works in both camera modes
  - Visual debug feedback (collision circles)
  - Console commands for collision management

### 7. Responsive Full-Screen Canvas System ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Complete
- **Features:**
  - Canvas resizes to fit browser window
  - Maintains aspect ratio, black bars as needed
  - Smooth transitions during resize
  - Console commands for canvas info

### 8. Console Commands and Developer Tools ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Complete
- **Features:**
  - Full console system with extensible command registry
  - Commands for movement, stats, zoom, perspective, world/chunk info, cache info, input blocking, UI debug, and more

### 9. Basic UI System ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Complete
- **Features:**
  - Inventory system (B to open/close)
  - Grid-based layout, click detection, visual feedback
  - Action bar system (primary and secondary bars, macro support)
  - Macro UI for creation, editing, binding, and icon management
  - Skins UI for entity image management, render mode, and metadata
  - Input blocking is robust and focus-based

### 10. Action Bar Implementation ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Complete
- **Features:**
  - Dual action bars (number keys 1-0, Shift+1-0)
  - Macro binding and execution
  - Visual feedback for hover, click, and key press
  - Modularized for future expansion

### 11. Crafting UI and Recipe System üü°
- **Status:** Basic crafting UI and 4 starter recipes implemented
- **Planned:** Extensible recipe system, advanced crafting stations, and item management

### 12. Macro Management UI System ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Complete
- **Features:**
  - Visual macro management, icon upload/generation, action bar binding
  - Macro data saved to localStorage

---

## üñºÔ∏è Entity Rendering & Caching (NEW in Step 2/3)
- **Status:** Complete for Step 2 goals
- **Features:**
  - Per-entity render mode (shape/sprite)
  - Async preloading and robust caching (in-memory + localStorage)
  - Skins UI for managing entity images, render modes, and metadata
  - Metadata support (size, angle, offsets)
  - Hitbox decoupling: Partial (full system planned)

---

## üöß Technical Debt & Refactor Opportunities
- Entities (grass, trees, rocks) are not proper classes; extending behavior is not DRY
- Some logic is duplicated across files
- Some files are too long and need splitting/modularization
- Homegrown module system; initialization is spread across files and not fully orchestrated from `init.js`
- UI components (inventory, macro, skins) could be more modular and reusable
- No automated tests; all testing is manual

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
- All core Step 2 features are implemented and tested
- Some features are partial or planned (see above)
- The codebase is robust, but further modularization and refactoring will improve maintainability and extensibility
- See README for up-to-date status and roadmap
