# Phase 7: Rendering Fixes and Final Tightening

## Overview

This phase focuses on fixing critical rendering issues and tightening up the codebase before implementing comprehensive testing and code quality enforcement in Phase 8.

## Critical Rendering Issues

### 1. Map Wrapping Issue - North Direction

**Problem**: When the player approaches the top of the map, they do not appear to wrap around to the bottom of the map smoothly. Instead, as you go north, the plains background disappears for a little bit and then pops in with a weird smear effect.

**Root Cause**: Likely a coordinate wrapping issue where the background is loading with some offset or delay due to a bug in the coordinate transformation logic.

**Investigation Needed**:
- Verify coordinate wrapping logic matches the original JavaScript game
- Check background rendering offset calculations
- Ensure smooth transition when crossing map boundaries

**Expected Behavior**: Player should smoothly transition from top to bottom of map without visual artifacts or delays.

### 2. Background Rotation Issue - South Direction

**Problem**: When going south in player perspective mode, the background plains is rendered very strangely. The background is not rotating around the player like the rest of the game world entities.

**Root Cause**: Background rendering is not properly integrated with the camera rotation system.

**Investigation Needed**:
- Verify background rendering follows camera rotation
- Check if background uses the same coordinate transformation as entities
- Ensure background rotates consistently with player perspective

**Expected Behavior**: Background should rotate smoothly with the camera, maintaining proper perspective relative to the player.

### 3. Player Direction Indicator Issue - Fixed-Angle Mode

**Problem**: When in fixed-angle mode, if the camera is facing south, the player's line indicator on their circular character is completely inverted:
- When going south, the line points north
- When going north, the line points south  
- When going east, the line points west
- When going west, the line points east

**Root Cause**: Direction indicator calculation is not accounting for camera rotation in fixed-angle mode.

**Investigation Needed**:
- Check direction indicator calculation logic
- Verify camera rotation is properly considered in fixed-angle mode
- Ensure indicator direction matches actual movement direction

**Expected Behavior**: Player direction indicator should always point in the actual direction of movement, regardless of camera orientation.

### 4. Camera Rotation Speed Issue - Fixed-Angle Mode

**Problem**: The left and right arrow keys to turn the camera are too fast in fixed-angle mode.

**Requirements**:
- Camera rotation speed should match player movement speed
- Turn speed should be reduced for better control

**Expected Behavior**: Smooth, controlled camera rotation that matches the game's movement pacing.
